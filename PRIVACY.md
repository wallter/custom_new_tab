# Privacy Policy

## Overview

Thank you for using the Custom New Tab Chrome Extension ("the Extension"). This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Extension. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting it.

## Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data, browsing history, or other user information. The Extension operates entirely on your device and does not send any data to external servers or third parties.

### Specifically, we do not:
- Collect any personally identifiable information (PII).
- Track your browsing history.
- Store any data beyond what is necessary for the extension to function on your device.

## Permissions

The Extension may require certain permissions to function correctly (e.g., access to modify your new tab settings), but these permissions are strictly limited to the operation of the Extension. No data collected via these permissions is transmitted or shared.

## Custom URLs

When you set a custom URL as your new tab homepage, this information is stored locally on your device and is not accessible to us or any third party. The Extension does not track or log the URLs you choose.

## Third-Party Links

If you choose to redirect your new tab to a third-party website, such as [https://chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com), please note that those websites may have their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any third-party websites you visit.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document, and the "Last Updated" date at the bottom will be revised accordingly.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the use of your data, please feel free to contact us at [your email/contact information].
